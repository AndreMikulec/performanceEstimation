# performanceEstimation

An R package providing an infra-structure for performance estimation and experimental comparison of predictive models.

**To Install or Update do the following in R:**

    install.packages("performanceEstimation")

After installation, the package can be used as any other R package by doing:

    library(performanceEstimation)

The accompanying package vignette, available as a PDF file through the standard R help system (after package installation), or available in the folder **packageVignette** of the current repository, contains an extensive description of the main functionalities of the package, as well as plenty of illustrative examples. On the same folder of this repository you will also find the R script file **performanceEstimation.R** that contains all R code of the examples in the package vignette, which will allow you to easily replicate all examples in that document.

Further help and illustrations can be obtained through the many help pages of each function defined in the package that contain lots of illustrative examples. Again, these help pages can be accessed as any other R package, through R help system (e.g. running **help.start()** at R command line)
